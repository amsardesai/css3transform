CSS3 Transform Tool
==========

CSS3 Transform is a simple tool for calculating the matrix equivalent of a series of transformations to a CSS element. The newest version of CSS (CSS3) allows developers to transform elements with various combinations of translating, scaling, rotating, and skewing. Since each individual transformation can be represented by a single matrix, multiplying these matrices together will result in a single matrix that can represent a series of transformations.
